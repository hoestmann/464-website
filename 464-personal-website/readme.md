My course project will be a personal page. 
 - I plan to have a home page with the same info as my resume.
 - A portfolio page with personal projects
 - A page describing my schooling
 - A page describing my internship experience
 - A page about my life and interests
 - A page where people can contact me

 Each pages uses flexboxs for layout along with header, body, sections, and footer. The website has a light and dark theme

 Users will be able to interact with a contact me form on the contact page
